(1) When we apply recursion ?
ans. -> when situation of Try All The Possible Ways and in this count ways or best(max or min) type problem occurs
            then we apply recursion

(2) Trick for recurance realation in recursion.
step -> 1: Try to represent the problem in term of index if array probelm then ok but for other problems represent 
           in index.
step -> 2: Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement.
step -> 3: sum up all sutffs -> if question says count all ways 
           take minimum of all stuffs -> if question says find minimum
           take maximum of all stuffs -> if question says find maximum
